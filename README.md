# IT266-Farming-SimuQuaketor
### BRANCH IS MASTER
Work for my IT266 project, the Quake 4 mod Farming Simuquaketor, as well as other Quake 4 mod work.

## How to play:
(All features can be seen using the cheat "give all weapons" in the cheat menu (ctrl + alt + ~))

### Planter Gun:
* Left Mouse: Fires a normal blaster's hitscan bullet
* Hold Left: "Charges" the gun. When it releases, it will plant a "crop" (a turret that over time spawns "ammo fruit")

### Breeder Gun:
* Left Mouse: when it hits a monster (right now, when it hits any idAI), it will cause the monster to "birth" a strogg.
